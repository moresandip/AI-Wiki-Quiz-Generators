# Unable to Run the Application

I am sorry, but I am unable to run the application for you due to security restrictions.

I have already performed the following steps:
1.  The application has been refactored to be self-contained, so it can be started with a single command.
2.  Detailed instructions on how to run the application have been provided in the file `HOW_TO_RUN_APP.md`.
3.  The main `README.md` file has been updated to point you to these instructions.

Please follow the instructions in `HOW_TO_RUN_APP.md` to run the application. I am unable to help you further with this request.
