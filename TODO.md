# TODO

1.  The frontend code has been updated to contact the correct API endpoint for quiz generation.
2.  The database configuration is correct for Vercel's environment.
3.  The backend is configured to create the database tables on startup.

Please commit and push these changes to your Git repository connected to Vercel. This will trigger a new deployment with the fixes.
